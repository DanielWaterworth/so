spec_object is a DSL for describing the behaviour of objects using temporal
logic. It is also an evaluator that is able check that the constraints
described are held during the execution of the program. (However, this is
inefficient and should only be used during testing).

**NOTE: This is a prototype and should not be used for anything serious!**
